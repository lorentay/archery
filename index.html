          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen,
             after competing with the US Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. A father or three, Giap was not 
             satisified with the archery education options availble for his childern. He wanted a place for them to learn valuable
             life skills through the disipline of archery. He's dedicated Straight to the Point Archery to that mission. From Beginner to Elite, 
             archers of all ages and ability learn about this exciting Olympic and international sport.
